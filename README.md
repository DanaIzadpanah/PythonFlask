Developing RESTful APIs with Python and Flask
Guide
Introduction
This guide, created by Dana, walks you through building a RESTful API using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It covers everything from setting up your environment to deploying your API in a Docker container.

Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python
Familiarity with web concepts
Setting Up Your Environment
- Install Python 3: Ensure Python 3.7 or newer is installed.
- Install Pip: Python's package manager, used for installing Flask.
- Install Flask: Run pip install Flask in your terminal.

Creating Your First Flask Application
- Hello World App: Create a file hello.py and write a basic Flask app to return "Hello, World!".
- Running the App: Use the command flask --app hello run.

Developing RESTful Endpoints
- Basic Endpoints: Create endpoints in Flask to handle HTTP methods like GET and POST.
- Data Handling: Use Python dictionaries to handle data initially.

Structuring with Python Classes
- Defining Models: Create Python classes to represent your data more effectively.
- Refactoring: Update your Flask app to use these new classes.

Serialization with Marshmallow
- Introduction to Marshmallow: Utilize Marshmallow for object serialization and deserialization.
- Applying Marshmallow: Integrate Marshmallow into your Flask app to handle JSON data.

This guide provides a streamlined path to creating a basic RESTful API with Flask and Python. Explore further to enhance your application's capabilities.
